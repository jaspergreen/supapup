# Detached Frame Error - Test Report

## Issue Description
Consistent "Attempted to use detached Frame" errors when using certain tools after page navigation or DOM changes.

## Affected Tools
- `form_detect`
- `page_execute_and_wait`
- Potentially other tools that hold page references

## Root Cause
Tools are initialized with a Puppeteer Page reference that becomes invalid when:
1. The page navigates to a new URL
2. The page context changes (e.g., after form submission)
3. Frames are added/removed from the page

## Current Architecture Issue
```typescript
// Tools hold onto page reference
this.formTools = new FormTools(page);

// When page navigates, the reference becomes stale
// but the tool still tries to use it
```

## Suggested Fix
1. **Option 1**: Pass page reference on each method call instead of constructor
2. **Option 2**: Get fresh page reference from browser tools before each operation
3. **Option 3**: Implement a page reference refresh mechanism

## Impact
- High cognitive load for AI agents
- Unpredictable tool behavior
- Requires browser restart to recover

## Workaround
Close and reopen browser between operations that change page context.
